The photograph shows an Indigenous woman with a compelling gaze, her long hair falling past her shoulders. She wears a headband across her forehead and a traditional garment adorned with what appears to be bone or shell necklaces, indicative of her cultural attire. Her posture and the directness of her gaze suggest a strong presence and a deep-rooted sense of identity.
